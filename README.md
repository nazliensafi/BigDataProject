# Big Data 2024, Group 28 Project Summary

## Project Definition
This project aims to develop a recommender system for suggesting movies to users based on their historical ratings. The system seeks to uncover and analyze patterns in movie preferences and provide personalized movie recommendations.

## Dataset
The project utilizes the MovieLens dataset, created by GroupLens, a research group in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Minnesota. It contains 25000095 ratings and 1093360 tag applications across 62423 movies. These data were created by 162541 users between January 09, 1995 and November 21, 2019. This dataset was generated on November 21, 2019.
Users were selected at random for inclusion. All selected users had rated at least 20 movies. No demographic information is included. Each user is represented by an id, and no other information is provided. The data are contained in the files genome-scores.csv, genome-tags.csv, links.csv, movies.csv, ratings.csv and tags.csv. publicly available for download at http://grouplens.org/datasets/.
The three key features employed are user ID, movie ID, and ratings. User ID serves as a unique identifier for each user, while movie ID uniquely identifies each movie in the dataset. Ratings represent the feedback provided by users on movies they watched. Ratings are made on a 5-star scale, with half-star increments.

## Research Questions
The core questions guiding this project are:
How can we accurately recommend movies to users based on their past interactions? 
What models to use on this large dataset? and how do we compare them?
How do we test the performance and ensure the quality of the results?

## Model Design and Implementation
We plan to use Collaborative Filtering approach, leveraging matrix factorization techniques to predict user ratings for movies they haven't yet seen. The primary algorithm used is the ALS (Alternating Least Squares) method in Apache Spark MLlib, chosen for its scalability and effectiveness in handling sparse datasets.
As it is shown to be more efficient in practice, we will explore the possibility of item-item Collaborative Filtering as opposed to user-item CF which Apache Spark uses. Finally, we will evaluate the recommendation model by measuring the root-mean-square error of rating prediction.
